This project is the first step toward replacing the [apears to be] unsupported OTTER program.  The primary goals are:

1) Import show/episode data from OTTER into a SqLite database.

2) Scan OTR files creating a unique fingerprint that is independant of any ID3 tags and add the fingerprint into the SqLite database linking it to a show/episode.

3) Identify files using the fingerprint to lookup the show/episode it belongs to.  Because this will be done via the fingerprint, no additional information shuch as file name or ID3 tags is needed [as lond as this version of the show/episode has already been added to the database].

4) Add new show/episodes to the database where one didn't previously exist using information in the filename.  [This will obviously require a standardized filename format to be implemented.]  Once the show/episode have been added the filename may be changed to anything and the file will maintane it's relationship to the show/episode by the fingerprint.
